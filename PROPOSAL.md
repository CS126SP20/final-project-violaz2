# [Ping Pong Game]

For my final project, I want to make a ping pong game, because I loved to play ping pong as a kid. I plan on using [PretzelGUI](https://github.com/cwhitney/PretzelGui) in order to make finding the positions of the paddles and ball easier, and I also plan on using [SQLiteModernCPP and SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to keep score.

Rough timeline of how I will get this done-

Week 1: I plan on first using my time to understand PretzelGui and to set up the library correctly. Then, I will begin creating the UI for the game.

Week 2: I will continue creating the UI for the game; I will create the ball and the two paddles and set them to the right positions on the screen. I will also implement the movement of the ball so that it bounces off the walls of the screen and the paddles, and the movement of the paddles so that they can move up and down.

Week 3: I will implement the leaderboard for the game and keep score on the screen. When the game is over, I will load a "Game Over" page with the top three scores. Overall, I will spend the last week making my game look better.

If I have extra time, I would like to speed up the ball as the game goes on. I would also like to add background music to the game.
